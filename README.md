Influenza is a persistent global health threat,causing significant annual morbidity and mortality. Effective detection, prediction, and response are essential. Traditional methods often lack real-time insights for proactive interventions. Advances in data analytics, especially anomaly detection and time series forecasting, can enhance surveillance. EpiGuard project aims to leverage these advancements to improve influenza prediction and detection. It seeks to develop a system that provides early warnings and forecasts trends, aiding in preparedness, resource allocation, and response strategies. This will help reduce the impact of outbreaks and save lives. EpiGuard's predictive model will use multivariate time series analytics to detect anomalies and forecast trends, enabling timely interventions and efficient resource use by public health authorities.
